ACE-RN starter contains:
- A good/clean pattern/architecture: call service from UI => 
service calls thunk and updates store (no return: no side effects, 
  one source of truth: store) => UI uses selector (middlewares work in between).
- Testable components / screens.
- Already configured fonts.
- Already configured icons.
- Redux toolkit, redux persist, thunks all typed.
- Offline notice.
- Full screen.
- RTL support
- Sentry.
- I18n.
- Theming with color schemes (exp. dark mode).
- Network service with DI, provider configurable with token&refresh, 
cancel token, interceptors and error handling.
- Environment variables already configured.
- Global loader: middleware to detect loading then add it to global slice or 
dispatch directly to global reducer from UI.
- Global error: service => thunk (reject) => middleware (dispatch global error)
 => state updated by thunk => UI toast selector.
- Rollback transactions options in case of failure.
- Singletons that are used to store critical info in memory but not persisted.
- Logger per API (allowed APIs for logging + allowed levels) / per user 
implicit (no need to add it by developers) and Networking requests logs.
- Performance: implicit: inside logger with a reference to message.
